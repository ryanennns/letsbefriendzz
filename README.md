# Hi, I'm Ryan.

I write good code for average purposes.

I also <a href="https://soundcloud.com/friendzzchan">make music and stuff</a>.

Here are some cool projects I've made.

## <a href=https://www.github.com/letsbefriendzz/Java-RayCasting/>3D Ray Caster</a> in Java

This just in: Ryan is rendering poorly shaded spheres! In this project, I'm creating my own ray tracer from the ground up. Currently working on supporting more complex mesh shapes and implementing lighting.

## <a href="https://www.github.com/letsbefriendzz/pycolours">Colour Format Conversion</a> in Python

I like math. I like colours. I wanted to explore how they're manipulated digitally.

In this program I implemented various RGB / HSV conversion algorithms, and tested using OpenCV.

## <a href="https://github.com/letsbefriendzz/LCBO-Rank-App">LCBO API</a> in Python

A work in progress API that serves LCBO data.

## <a href="https://www.github.com/letsbefriendzz/Python2D/">2D Image & GIF Rendering</a> using Python & OpenCV

Draws coordinate shapes in 2D using my own methods and classes. OpenCV is used to bounce the animations to GIF or static image formats.
